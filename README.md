## Content : Decentralized Traffic Control System

In this project we have used YOLO v5 (You Only Look Once) model, which is very smart model, can able to detect and classify LMVs (Light Motor Vehicle) and HMVs(Heavy Motor motor vehicle).

Here we detect and classify the LMV and HMV vehicles, which increases the total count of the lane.
The total count is further used to calculate the time taken to cross the junction.

The calculated time is further used to turn on the green light and regulate the traffic lights.

By doing so, we reduce the waiting time for the vehicles that have been waiting at the junction for a long time.
