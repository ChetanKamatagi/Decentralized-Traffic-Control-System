In this project we have used YOLO v5 (You Only Look Once) Model which is very smart model, can able to detect and classify the LMVs and HMVs.

Here we detect and classify the LMV and HMV vehicles and by which we are increasing the total count of the lane.
The total count is further used to calculate the time taken to cross the junction.

The calculated time is further used to turn on the green light and regulate the traffic lights.

By this, we reduce the waiting time of the vehicles waiting in the junction for long time.
